# Learning Common Lisp

## CLISP

```bash
sudo apt-get install clisp
brew install clisp
```

### Starting CLISP

```bash
clisp
```

### Stopping CLISP

```lisp
(quit)
```

### Why CLISP?

Coz I'd love to use Steel-Bank Common Lisp (SBCL), but I don't have time to learn emacs and SLIME right now! And I'd rather have fun with Lisp frankly.

### When CLISP goes funky!

```lisp
:q
```

## Loading Lisp files

```lisp
(load "test.lisp")
```
